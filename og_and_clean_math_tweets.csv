"【中1向け】文字式⑤
よく見るミス
(例)
y×y×y=y^3
(y^3はyとする)
yを3回掛けると上付きの累乗

y+y+y=3y
yを3回足すときは3をyの前に。yは本来1yで1を省略するルールなので、
1y+1y+1y=3yと意識すれば3の位置も納得いくだろう

文字式はルールであり、数式を言葉と考えて、式を伝える事を意識しよう","Character expression for middle 1 ⑤ Frequently seen mistake example yyyy3 y3 is y Multiply y by 3 times and superscript power yyy3y When y is added 3 times, 3 is before y and y is originally 1y and 1 is omitted. So if you think about 1y1y1y3y, you will be satisfied with the position of 3. Character expressions are rules, so let's be aware that formulas are considered as words and convey formulas."

"Pro tip:

To know if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits of the number and check if it is divisible by 3. Repeat as many times as necessary.

e.g.
51 = 5 + 1
5 + 1 = 6

This is the only math trick that stayed in my mind after over a decade of relying on calculators. https://t.co/ggCXjWoPdn","pro tip: to know if a number is divisible by 3, add the digits of the number and check if it is divisible by 3. repeat as many times as necessary. e.g. 51  5  1 5  1  6 this is the only math trick that stayed in my mind after over a decade of relying on calculators. https://t.co/ggcxjwopdn"
